- The key to cipher is really great! Optionally you could rephrase the request for 's' as it could be misunderstood. You could say "Please choose an integer as a password to ensure that only you will be able to decipher your message! " and then "Please insert your password for decryption: "

- There is a little bug, when you decipher a sentence, the spaces get lost and the string is not separated.

- You could try to define a function for the user input, so that you could lead the user back to "hi" in case of a type, so he does not have to start the program over
